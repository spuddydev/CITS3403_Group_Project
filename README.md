# To Do
## Database
- login verification for each page(not login/home)
- login error attempts


# Remember
- when writing readme include installing playwright
pecific Implementation Gaps:

The saved.html template expects project filtering logic that might not be fully implemented in the backend.
Several places in the HTML templates use hardcoded data (like connections and trends) instead of database information.
There's no actual implementation of adding supervisors to user connections - only the UI elements exist.
The profile page shows connections, but there's no database schema or logic to handle user-to-user connections.
The sidebar in base.html has been updated with new links, but the template conditions might not correctly highlight the active page.
